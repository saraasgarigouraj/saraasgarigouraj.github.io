Using difference-in-differences and event study methods, I find RML increases first-time enrollments by up to 9%, particularly out-of-state enrollments, without affecting degree completion rates. The impact is strongest for non-selective public colleges in early-adopting states. RML does not appear to influence college prices, quality, or in-state enrollment.</description></item></channel></rss>
