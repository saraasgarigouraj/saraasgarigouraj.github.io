\item From High School to Higher Education: Is recreational marijuana a consumption amenity  for US college students? (Sole Author)

\textit{Abstract: } This paper examines how recreational marijuana legalization (RML) affects first-time college enrollment in the US using a unique college-level dataset and various estimation methods such as difference-in-differences, event study, and synthetic controls. I find that RML increases enrollments by 4.6\% to 9\%, without compromising degree completion, and it boosts college competitiveness in RML states by offering a positive amenity, as evidenced by the rise in non-local enrollments relative to neighboring states. In addition, I find no evidence that RML affects college prices, quality, or local enrollment. This effect is stronger for non-selective public colleges in early-adopting RML states.

{\textsc{\textbf{Working Papers}}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[1.]  What is the Role of College Athletics? An Analysis of the Population of NCAA Athletes (with Tyler Ransom)

\textit{Abstract:} Admissions at elite private universities in the United States are becoming increasingly competitive. As competition increases, seats become more and more scarce. This paper analyzes the population of athletes at all Division I NCAA institutions. Using publicly available data from the US Department of Education, the NCAA, and institutions' athletic rosters, we document several novel facts. First, elite institutions enroll more athletes and field more varsity teams than even the largest public institutions, despite having drastically smaller student bodies. To provide further context on the background of athletes at elite institutions, we supplement the institution-level analysis with individual-level data taken from publicly available athletic rosters. Finally, we analyze the effect of a hypothetical policy that would restrict student athletes at each universities to be less than a certain fraction of the overall student body.

\item[2.] What Spurs Investment in the Vaccine Industry? Interplay of Competition and Subsidies (with Myongjin Kim,  Junying Zhao,  Ghosh Pallab, and Firat Demir) 

\textit{Abstract: } This paper investigates the impact of supply- and demand-side policy interventions on firms' output and innovation. Leveraging a unique dataset on vaccine production and development, we evaluate the effectiveness of a tort reform, a supply-side policy intervention that reduces vaccine manufacturers' product liability, and a demand-side policy intervention, the expansion of Medicare coverage of select vaccine products. Our difference-in-differences analysis indicates that while both interventions result in significant increases in vaccine production, the impact of the demand-side policy can be 3-6 times greater in magnitude. There is also evidence suggesting that vaccine development responds exclusively to the demand-side policy.
